Fully functional external (readonly) Assaultcube 1.3.0.2 hack

This was my testproject to get into reverse engineering.
I made it back in lockdown days and found it by cleaning my personal repos.

I thought better to release it instead of delete it.

It has a functional ESP for player and pickable entities.
It also has kind of a human like aimbot. I found the initial source in a python project which I translated to C++.

Maybe it helps someone.
